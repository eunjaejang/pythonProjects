### Note: Performance metrics for regression model

Here are three common evaluation metrics for regression problems:

**Mean Absolute Error** (MAE) is the mean of the absolute value of the errors:

$$\frac 1n\sum_{i=1}^n|y_i-\hat{y}_i|$$

**Mean Squared Error** (MSE) is the mean of the squared errors:

$$\frac 1n\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2$$

**Root Mean Squared Error** (RMSE) is the square root of the mean of the squared errors:

$$\sqrt{\frac 1n\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2}$$

**Integral Example**
$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

### UML diagrams

You can also render sequence diagrams like this:

```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
```

And flow charts like this:

```flow
st=>start: Start
e=>end
op=>operation: My Operation
cond=>condition: Yes or No?

st->op->cond
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op
```
